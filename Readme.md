# userAuth: MERN Stack User Authentication Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for building a secure and professional-grade user authentication system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This backend-focused project allows you to quickly set up the core functionalities for user registration, login, and token-based authentication.

## Features

* **MERN Stack:** Utilizes popular technologies for building scalable and efficient backend services.
* **Modular Structure:** Clear folder organization with separation of concerns for maintainability.
* **Secure Authentication:** Implements an access token (short-lived) and refresh token (long-lived) strategy for robust authentication.
* **Postman Tested:** Includes endpoints ready for testing and integration with your frontend application.
* **Professional Grade:** Designed with security and scalability in mind.

│   ├── controllers
│   ├── db
│   ├── middleware
│   ├── routes
│   ├── utils
│   ├── models
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── constants.js
│   └── index.js

```
## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/omer-here/userAuth.git](https://github.com/omer-here/userAuth.git)

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory and install required dependencies:

   ```bash
    cd userAuth
    npm install
    ```
3. **Configure Environment:**

    Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the following values:

    MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string.
    JWT_SECRET: A strong and secure secret key for generating access and refresh tokens.

 4. **Start the Server:**

    Run the following command to start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
 5. **Testing with Postman:**

    Refer to the comments within the routes directory for API endpoint details. You can use tools like Postman to send test requests and verify functionalities.

    Note: This is a backend-only starter template. You will need to build a separate frontend application to interact with the API endpoints.

## Security Considerations
Replace the placeholder JWT_SECRET with a strong and unique secret key before deployment.
Implement additional security measures like rate limiting and input validation to prevent attacks.
